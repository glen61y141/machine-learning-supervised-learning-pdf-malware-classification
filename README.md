# machine-learning-supervised-learning-pdf-malware-classification

Trains 5 supervised machine learning algorithms with the popular contagio pdf malware dataset and plots learning curves to easily verify low bias and variance.

## Data Preprocessing

In the [preprocessing](preprocessing) folder you will find the py file to produce the [norm.csv](data/norm.csv) file used for training. String features were numerically encoded and the filename feature was dropped. Finally, the dataset was processed through the [MinMaxScalar](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler) and saved to a csv in the [data](data) folder.

## Supervised Learning

In the [learners](learners) folder you will find 5 supervised learning algorithms configured to classify pdf malware. [GridsearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#) is used to find the optimal hyperparameters. The templates provided can be reused on any dataset with minimal tweaking. Specifically, one can add additional hyperparameter values to search. However, it is necessary to review the learning curve to make sure the model did not overfit. A typical case of overfitting is when the cross validation error increases while the training error stays constant or decreases.

### Cross-validation

Each learner uses 5-fold stratified cross validation.
